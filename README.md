## News and Blog App
This is a small project to understand how to make API requests using **Retrofit** library, how to use **Room** library, **Live Data** and how to integrate Google Sign In 
in the app using **Firebase**. The posts and content that users add in the blog part of the app is stored in Firebase Database. Also the news and blog are in two different 
fragments seperated by a navigation drawer in a single activity.

* Firebase
* Room, View Model, Live Data (MVVM)
